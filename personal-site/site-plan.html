      <p>Emerald Titan boasts a unique blend of blue curacao and vanilla flavors, creating a delicious flavor that will leave you wanting more. With its emerald green color and smooth, light texture, it's unlike any soda you've ever tasted.</p>

      <p>How do we make it? Well, it starts with original Mtn Dew&trade; then we add our unique blend of flavoring, pour it over ice, and then it's yours to enjoy!</p>

      <p>Where did it start? A high-schooler who goes by Ore_Father, and his friend, Emerald Titan, worked together at a restaraunt where they served mixed sodas. One day they got creative and started mixing things together, and came up with this. Due to it's unique shade of green, it was quickly dubbed the Emerald Titan.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        A high-schooler who goes by Ore_Father, and his friend, Emerald Titan, worked together at a restaraunt where they served mixed sodas. One day they got creative and started mixing things together, and came up with this. Due to it's unique shade of green, it was quickly dubbed the Emerald Titan. Since then, the restaraunt has changed owners and names, and the Emerald Titan is no longer served there, thus this page bringing it to you and the masses.
